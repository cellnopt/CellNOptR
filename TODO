1. cutAndPlotResultsTN should use multi plot for large data sets like in T1
   version.
2. computeScoreTN: can provide simResPrev only for T2. TN N>2 does not work
   properly. Only the full bistrings option works, which is not efficient in
   gaBinaryTN
3. cleanup plotOptimResults family.
4. use timeValues instead of timeIndex everywhere.
