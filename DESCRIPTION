Description: This add-on to the package CellNOptR handles time-course data, as opposed to steady state data in CellNOptR. It uses a number of approaches to allow the comparison of logic simulation and data: scaling the simulation step, calculating 2 steady states for early and late edges in the model (reactions) and optimizing delays on each edge.
