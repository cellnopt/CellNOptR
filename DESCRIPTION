Title: Integration of CellNOptR to add missing links
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2013-04-04
Author: F.Eduati
Maintainer: F.Eduati <eduati@ebi.ac.uk>
Depends: R (>= 2.15.0), CellNOptR (>= 1.4.0), graph
Suggests: minet, catnet, igraph, Rgraphviz, RUnit, BiocGenerics
biocViews: CellBasedAssays, CellBiology, Proteomics, Bioinformatics, NetworkInference
Description: This package integrates literature-constrained and data-driven methods to infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. It permits to extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods, and uses information on physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links.
