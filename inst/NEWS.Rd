         \itemize{
            \item{major update that changes User Interface to uniformise the code for
                  users and developers (e.g., readSif function is now called readSIF and prep4Sim is prep4sim).
                  Similarly many arguments are not required anymore. For instance, indexList and simList are not required
                  anymore (for back compatibilty these 2 arguments are usually kept and
                    set to NULL).}
            \item{improvment of  plotModel function to have more graphviz options}
            \item{gaBinary default initBstring argument is set to ones.}

            \item{simulateTN  combines simulateT1 and simulateTN so only one function is required.}
            \item{gaBinaryT2 is deprecated. Use TN version instead.}
            \item{gaBinaryT1 and TN do no need the indexList and simList parameters anymore}
             \item{preprocessing now returns only the model. indices are not required anymore.
                      preprocessing can now handle model without cnolist provided (e.g. for expansion only)}
            \item{add a cutAndPlot dispatcher that calls the proper cutandPlotResultsTX function.}
             \item{cutSimList argument called bitString renamed bString (developers)}
            \item{computeScoreT1, cutSimList had an argument called bitString. it is now called
                   bString and this convention is used throughout the code (e.g., bStringT1 not
                   bitStringT1) simlist and indexlist are now optional are after the bString
                   argument.}
            \item{ show argument removed from cutAndPlot function family}
         }
