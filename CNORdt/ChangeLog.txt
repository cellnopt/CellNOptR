* 1.5.1: add checkSignals inside gaBinaryDT

Release 1.4
================

bioconductor

Release 1.2
=================


* 1.1

* 1.1.1
    * gaDiscreteDT returns an additional field called bScore for the final best Score. The hash table is limited to 1000
    * change init_values - set anything that is not stimulus/inhibitor to 'prevSim' status
    * this fixes issue with spike in time course caused by initial NAs

* version 0.99.6
    * corrected issues with vignette

* version 0.99.5
    * major restructuring for bioconductor submission
    * leaving out time-scales for the moment
    * they will be reintroduced for delay version

* version 0.99.3
     * refactoring of example/man due to modifications of the data filename.

* version 0.99.2
    * arguments' name now following convention from CellNOpt. All manual and code changed accordingly.


TODO:
=====
* Spikes in simulation again - come back to
* Check color gradient when plotting (comparably too much red?)
* slow-down caused by class conversion
* Add t=0 changes - DONE
* Check spikes in time course caused by NAs - DONE
* Spike has moved to nfkb in example - DONE

Topics to expand:
====================
* Asynchronous updating with training?
* Application of Gillespie algorithm, stochastic (MaBoSS?)
* Delay version
    * R simulator is ready, needs to be written in C
    * Optimization with MEIGO
