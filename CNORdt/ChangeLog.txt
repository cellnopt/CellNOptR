version 1.1.1
------------------
* change init_values - set anything that is not stimulus/inhibitor to 'prevSim' status
* this fixes issue with spike in time course caused by initial NAs

version 0.99.6
------------------
* corrected issues with vignette

version 0.99.5
------------------
* major restructuring for bioconductor submission
* leaving out time-scales for the moment
* they will be reintroduced for delay version

version 0.99.3
------------------
* refactoring of example/man due to modifications of the data filename.

version 0.99.2
---------------
* arguments' name now following convention from CellNOpt. All manual and code changed accordingly.

TODO:
* Check color gradient when plotting (comparably too much red?)
* Add t=0 changes - DONE
* Check spikes in time course caused by NAs - DONE
* Spike has moved to nfkb in example
* slow-down caused by class conversion

Topics to expand:
* Asynchronous updating with training?
* Application of Gillespie algorithm, stochastic (MaBoSS?)
* Delay version
	* R simulator is ready, needs to be written in C
	* Optimization with MEIGO
