version 0.99.5
------------------
* major restructuring for bioconductor submission
* leaving out time-scales for the moment
* they will be reintroduced for delay version
* currently may be slow because of class compliance
* still need to sort out spikes at T=0

version 0.99.3
------------------
* refactoring of example/man due to modifications of the data filename.

version 0.99.2
---------------
* arguments' name now following convention from CellNOpt. All manual and code changed accordingly.

TODO:
* Check color gradient when plotting (comparably too much red?)
* Add t=0 changes
* Check spikes in time course caused by NAs

Topics to expand:
* Asynchronous updating with training?
* Application of Gillespie algorithm, stochastic (MaBoSS?)
* Delay version
	* R simulator is ready, needs to be written in C
	* Optimization with MEIGO
