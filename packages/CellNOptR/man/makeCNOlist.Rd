\title{
Make a CNOlist structure
}
\description{
This function takes as input the output of readMIDAS and extracts the elements
that are needed in a CNO project. Instead, please use the \code{CNOlist} class to read a MIDAS
file that will be converted to a CNOlist.
}
\usage{
makeCNOlist(dataset, subfield, verbose=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{
output of readMIDAS
}
  \item{subfield}{
TRUE or FALSE, specifies if the column headers contain subfields or not i.e. if
I should look for TR:sthg:sthg or just TR:sthg.
}
  \item{verbose}{
logical (default to TRUE) print information on the screen.
}
}
\details{
Be aware that most of the functions in this package, including this one, expect
the data to contain measurements at time 0, but these should all be equal to
zero according to the normalisation procedure that should be used. Therefore, if
you have one time point, the files valueSignals contains two matrices, one for
t0 and one for t1.

If there are replicate rows in the MIDAS file (i.e., identical cues and
identical time), this function averages the values of the measurements for these
replicates.

Columns with the following tags are ignored: NOINHIB, NO-INHIB, NO-LIG, NOCYTO.

\value{
a CNOlist with fields
\item{namesCues}{a vector of names of cues}
\item{namesStimuli}{a vector of names of stimuli}
\item{namesInhibitors}{a vector of names of inhibitors}
\item{namesSignals}{a vector of names of signals}
\item{timeSignals}{a vector of times}
\item{valueCues}{a matrix of dimensions nConditions x nCues, with 0 or 1 if the
    cue is present or absent in the particular condition}
\item{valueInhibitors}{a matrix of dimensions nConditions x nInhibitors, with 0
    or 1 if the inhibitor is present or absent in the particular condition}
\item{valueStimuli}{of dimensions nConditions x nStimuli, with 0 or 1 if the
    stimuli is present or absent in the particular condition}
\item{valueSignals}{a list of the same length as timeSignals, each element
    containing a matrix of dimensions nConditions x nsignals, with the measurements.}
\item{valueVariances}{a list of the same length as timeSignals, each element
    containing a matrix of dimensions nConditions x nsignals, with the standard
    deviation of the replicates.}
