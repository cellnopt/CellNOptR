    # !! hack. SimulatorT1 expect the inhibitors values to be 0 or 1.
    # Then, it flips them. So, the 0-values are flipped to 1. finally,
    # the values that are equal to 1 are set to NA...
    # Here, since this is T0, all inhibitors are set to 0. simulatorT1 will
    # therefore flip them to 1 and finally NA. So, we set all inhibitors to 1.

    # Need to be very careful if simulatorT1 changes

    # Finally run the simulator with the particular set of experiments at t0
