Release 1.3
================

* 1.3.2:
    * plotting function returns now a list with a field called simResults

* 1.3.1:
    * cSimulator does not convert cues to integer anymore so that floats can be
      used for stimuli and inhibitors
	

Release 1.2
===============

* 1.1.4:
    * cleaning up for bioconductor release

* 1.1.3:
	* gaDiscreteT1.R: fix issue when only 1 model was returned within tolerance 
	* reduceFuzzy.R fix bug that causes seg faut (model was not cut properly)
	* defaultParametersFuzzy.R: added nTF to set number of TF to arbitrary value (not tested)
	* cSimulator.R: added nSignals as input to the C function 
	* CNORwrapFuzzy.R: fixed pMutation argument that was not populated
	* src/simulatorT1.c: added nSginals that may be used in the future to return the simResults already cut

* 1.1.2:
	* gaDiscrete functions return best score as well in the dataframe.

* 1.1.1:
	* output names of the fields returned by gaDiscrete are now using camel
	  lower case so that plotFit from CellNoptR can be used 
	* add C simulator

* 1.1.0: increment version to be in agreement with boiconductor policy.
* 1.0.0: in bioconductor (oct 2012)


* 0.99.8:
	* add NEWS.Rd in inst
	* move tests in inst/unitTests

* 0.99.7: 
    * use new CNOlist class, 
    * add test
    * fix CNORwapFuzzy (default values), 
    * fix typos in writeNetwork. 
    * defaultParameters were always used in CNORwrapfuzzy (fixed).
    * finalised the vignette.

* 0.99.6: 
    * remove indexList and simList where possible. 
	* use preprocessing inside CNORwrapFuzzy, 
	* CNOList argument renamed in CNOlist, 
	* add hashtable in  gaDiscrete.

* 0.99.5: 
    * uniformisation of the names/arguments to reflect changes made in CellNOptR. 
	* Update vignettes

* 0.99.4: 
    * add computeScoreFuzzy
